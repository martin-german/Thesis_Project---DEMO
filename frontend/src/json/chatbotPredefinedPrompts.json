    "response": "This project was created by Martin Germán as part of his thesis at the University of Szeged in 2025. It was originally meant for young students (ages 12–25) to support their mental health—but it's grown into a safe and calm space for anyone navigating big transitions: students, early-career adults, or anyone needing focus, support, reflection, and kindness."
